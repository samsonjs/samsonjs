# Booyakasha!

I'm a software developer in Victoria, BC. Professionally I mostly make iOS and web apps and do system admin / devops (and dabble with Android). For fun, I mostly write Ruby and C and Swift. My personal site is [samhuri.net](https://samhuri.net) and you can find me on Mastodon at [@sjs@techhub.social](https://techhub.social/@sjs).

Most of my recent open source work is in Ruby and Swift. I'm a maintainer on [grape_logging](https://github.com/aserafin/grape_logging/commits?author=samsonjs) and [grape-active_model_serializers](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-active_model_serializers/commits?author=samsonjs). On the Swift side I made [SJSAssetExportSession](https://github.com/samsonjs/SJSAssetExportSession), a modern version of SDAVAssetExportSession for Swift 6 and strict concurrency, [AsyncMonitor](https://github.com/samsonjs/AsyncMonitor) for monitoring async sequences with Swift concurrency, and the now-Sherlocked [NotificationSmuggler](https://github.com/samsonjs/NotificationSmuggler) for embedding strongly-typed values in notification user-info dictionaries.

Back in the day I made [strftime](https://github.com/samsonjs/strftime), a strftime implementation for JavaScript that somehow picked up 650+ stars, and [format](https://github.com/samsonjs/format), a printf-like formatter for JS. In my more masochistic days I went cross-eyed reading Intel's mod-r/m docs and wrote this x86 [compiler](https://github.com/samsonjs/compiler) in Ruby. The last month that I lived out in Shawnigan Lake, I read The Little Schemer and wrote a little Scheme in C, called [lake](https://github.com/samsonjs/lake). My website uses this old thing, [gitter](https://github.com/samsonjs/gitter), which is a GitHub API client for Node and browsers and somehow still works.

I make tiny fixes and improvements to other open source projects now and then. And I've contributed dozens of typo fixes, which I'm possibly most proud of.
